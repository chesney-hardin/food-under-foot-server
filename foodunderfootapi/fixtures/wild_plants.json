            "description": "This perennial tree or shrub grows from 3 to 12 m tall. The drooping, pear-shaped leaves are alternate, from 10 to 30 cm long, with smooth margins and pointed tips.  The leaves are coated with fine whitish hairs on the upper surface with rusty-colored hairs on the under-side.  Leaves are aromatic, with a smell reminiscent of bell pepper. Inconspicuous but interesting flowers (4 to 5cm in diameter) with 3 sepals, are green upon opening and turn to dark purple or maroon in color.  From 1 to 4 flowers grow in the leaf axils before leafing, usually in April or May.  The six velvety petals (2cm-2.5cm long) are stiff and curl slightly backwards.  Yellowish green to brown, cylindrical, mango-shaped fruits are 7-16 cm long and grow solitarily or 2 to 4 together.  The large fruits (5 to 16 ounces) ripen between August and October.  Fruits have a thin skin, which contain a yellow custard-like pulp that is said to taste like papaya.  Some varieties contain a whitish-green pulp that is less flavorful.  Fruits contain several flat 2cm long seeds.  The deciduous leaves turn bright yellow before dropping in the fall.",
